### US-010: Integrate git commits for all mutations
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-007, US-008, US-009

Description:
As a user, I want every mutation committed so that all changes are auditable and reversible.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Git repository is detected or initialized within the library root
- [ ] Each write/edit/delete creates exactly one commit and returns the commit SHA
- [ ] Use a no-shell git library for operations; dependency install command documented: `pip install dulwich`
- [ ] Example: write_markdown produces a new commit and the response includes the SHA
- [ ] Negative case: if git initialization or commit fails, the mutation is rolled back and an error is returned
