### US-007: Add write_markdown operation for append/prepend
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-002

Description:
As a user, I want controlled single-file writes so that markdown can be updated safely and atomically.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] write_markdown supports append and prepend operations on markdown files
- [ ] Writes are atomic and preserve newline consistency
- [ ] Example: append adds content at the end of the file exactly as previewed
- [ ] Negative case: unsupported operation returns INVALID_OPERATION and leaves the file unchanged
