### US-013: Integration validation for MCP-only markdown execution
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-012

Description:
As a maintainer, I want integration validation so that all markdown operations flow through the MCP safely.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Integration tests route all Library markdown operations through the MCP server
- [ ] Agent simulation tests verify preview -> approve -> execute flow and concurrency safety
- [ ] External tool compatibility is verified via the MCP interface
- [ ] Example: integration test performs a write that results in diff, commit, and log entry
- [ ] Negative case: direct filesystem write bypassing MCP fails the test suite
