### US-012: Harden MCP contract with strict schemas and tests
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-003, US-004, US-005, US-006, US-007, US-008, US-009, US-010, US-011

Description:
As a client, I want strict schemas and predictable errors so that tool usage is safe and deterministic.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] All tool inputs are validated against strict schemas and unknown fields are rejected
- [ ] All responses follow a consistent JSON shape with stable error codes
- [ ] Unit tests cover validation and error semantics for each tool
- [ ] Example: providing an extra field returns UNKNOWN_FIELD with no side effects
- [ ] Negative case: invalid type for path returns INVALID_TYPE and no filesystem access occurs
