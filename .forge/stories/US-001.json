    "Project scaffold includes a FastAPI app entrypoint and MCP handler module",
    "Dependency install command documented and works: `pip install fastapi uvicorn pytest ruff`",
    "Config loads BRAINDRIVE_LIBRARY_PATH from environment and exposes it to the app",
    "Local dev run command documented and works: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`",
    "Health endpoint returns JSON with status ok and HTTP 200",
    "Example: GET /health returns {\"status\": \"ok\"}",
    "Negative case: starting without BRAINDRIVE_LIBRARY_PATH returns a clear config error and the server does not start"
