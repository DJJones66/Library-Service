### US-001: Scaffold MCP server with config and health endpoint
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a developer, I want a bootstrapped MCP server with configuration loading so that the service can start locally and enforce required setup.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Project scaffold includes a FastAPI app entrypoint and MCP handler module
- [ ] Dependency install command documented and works: `pip install fastapi uvicorn pytest ruff`
- [ ] Config loads BRAINDRIVE_LIBRARY_PATH from environment and exposes it to the app
- [ ] Local dev run command documented and works: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- [ ] Health endpoint returns JSON with status ok and HTTP 200
- [ ] Example: GET /health returns {"status": "ok"}
- [ ] Negative case: starting without BRAINDRIVE_LIBRARY_PATH returns a clear config error and the server does not start
