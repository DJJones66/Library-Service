### US-008: Add edit_markdown section-aware operations
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-007

Description:
As a user, I want section-aware edits so that targeted changes are reliable and reversible.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] edit_markdown supports replace_section, insert_before, and insert_after
- [ ] Target sections must exist; otherwise the operation fails safely
- [ ] Example: replace_section("## Scope") updates only the targeted section
- [ ] Negative case: replace_section("## Missing") returns SECTION_NOT_FOUND and leaves the file unchanged
