### US-006: Add preview_markdown_change operation
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-003

Description:
As a user, I want a diff preview for markdown edits so that changes are reviewable before any write.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] preview_markdown_change simulates edits in memory and returns unified diff, summary, and riskLevel
- [ ] Preview never writes to disk
- [ ] Example: preview append returns a diff and the file remains unchanged
- [ ] Negative case: preview on a non-markdown path returns NOT_MARKDOWN error and the file remains unchanged
