### US-002: Implement safety envelope and path validation utilities
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001

Description:
As a developer, I want shared path validation and structured errors so that all operations enforce the library boundary deterministically.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Path normalization rejects absolute paths, '..' traversal, and symlinks
- [ ] All tool inputs are validated against BRAINDRIVE_LIBRARY_PATH before any filesystem access
- [ ] Structured error responses include code, message, and details
- [ ] Example: validate_path("notes/spec.md") returns a normalized path within the library root
- [ ] Negative case: validate_path("../../etc/passwd") returns PATH_TRAVERSAL error without reading the filesystem
